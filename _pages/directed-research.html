    <p>
        Are you a USC student and looking for <strong>research experience?</strong> I am currently looking for good
        students that want to conduct small research projects in the area of modeling and simulation of parallel and
        distributed computing systems (cloud computing, grid computing, or clusters), with emphasis on the development
        of scheduling and resource provisioning algorithms.
    </p>

    <p>

        (<a href="mailto:rafsilva@isi.edu?subject=Interest in Directed Research Project"><i class="fas fa-envelope"></i>
