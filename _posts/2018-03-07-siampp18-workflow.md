title: The Interplay of Workflow Execution and Resource Provisioning
image: /assets/images/news/siampp18-workflow.png
description: This talk will examine issues of workflow execution, in particular using the Pegasus Workflow Management System, on distributed resources and how these resources can be provisioned ahead of the workflow execution. Pegasus was designed, implemented and supported to provide abstractions that enable scientists to focus on structuring their computations without worrying about the details of the target cyberinfrastructure. To support these workflow abstractions Pegasus provides automation capabilities that seamlessly map workflows onto target resources, sparing scientists the overhead of managing the data flow, job scheduling, fault recovery and adaptation of their applications. In some cases, it is beneficial to provision the resources ahead of the workflow execution, enabling the re-use of resources across workflow tasks. The talk will examine the benefits of resource provisioning for workflow execution.

**Abstract** --  This talk will examine issues of workflow execution, in particular using the Pegasus Workflow Management System, on distributed resources and how these resources can be provisioned ahead of the workflow execution. Pegasus was designed, implemented and supported to provide abstractions that enable scientists to focus on structuring their computations without worrying about the details of the target cyberinfrastructure. To support these workflow abstractions Pegasus provides automation capabilities that seamlessly map workflows onto target resources, sparing scientists the overhead of managing the data flow, job scheduling, fault recovery and adaptation of their applications. In some cases, it is beneficial to provision the resources ahead of the workflow execution, enabling the re-use of resources across workflow tasks. The talk will examine the benefits of resource provisioning for workflow execution.
