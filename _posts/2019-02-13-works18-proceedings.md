title: 13th Workflows in Support of Large-Scale Science – WORKS 2018 Proceedings
image: /assets/images/news/works2018.png
description: The Workshop on Workflows in Support of Large-Scale Science (WORKS) has been established as a premier forum on all aspects in relation to scientific workflows. The 13th edition of the workshop, WORKS 2018, co-located with SC18 in Dallas, Texas, USA, followed the successful tradition of previous years (Paris, 2006; Monterey Bay, 2007; Austin, 2008; Portland, 2009; New Orleans, 2010; Seattle, 2011; Salt Lake City, 2012; Denver, 2013; New Orleans, 2014; Austin, 2015; Salt Lake City, 2016; Denver, 2017). WORKS 2018 focuses on the many facets of data- intensive workflow management systems, ranging from data-intensive workflows representation and enactment to scheduling and resource allocation to provenance to workflow enactment on heterogeneous architectures as well as workflow tools and support environments.

The Workshop on Workflows in Support of Large-Scale Science (WORKS) has been established as a premier forum on all aspects in relation to scientific workflows. The 13th edition of the workshop, WORKS 2018, co-located with SC18 in Dallas, Texas, USA, followed the successful tradition of previous years (Paris, 2006; Monterey Bay, 2007; Austin, 2008; Portland, 2009; New Orleans, 2010; Seattle, 2011; Salt Lake City, 2012; Denver, 2013; New Orleans, 2014; Austin, 2015; Salt Lake City, 2016; Denver, 2017). WORKS 2018 focuses on the many facets of data- intensive workflow management systems, ranging from data-intensive workflows representation and enactment to scheduling and resource allocation to provenance to workflow enactment on heterogeneous architectures as well as workflow tools and support environments.

The Call for Papers attracted 19 submissions. After a rigorous review process where each paper received at least two reviews, 8 papers were accepted for a full presentation (acceptance rate 42%). The workshop took place on Sunday, 11 November 2018 and the program also featured an invited keynote by <a href="https://words.sdsc.edu/ilkay/home" target="_blank">Ilkay Altintas</a>, three lightning talks and a panel discussion. The proceedings include the eight full papers accepted and presented at the workshop. We would like to thank the authors, the presenters, the general chair, the steering committee, the publicity chairs, the program committee, and the SC18 workshop chairs – without their excellent work and contributions WORKS would not be successful.
