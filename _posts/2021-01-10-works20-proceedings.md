The workshop took place on Wednesday, 11 November 2020 and the program featured 
an invited keynote by Prof. [Michela Taufer](https://globalcomputing.group/about.html) 
(UTK), entitled "_In Situ Data Analytics for Next Generation Molecular Dynamics Workflows_". 
The program also featured talks from 8 research papers (accepted after a rigorous review 
process where each paper received at least three reviews). The proceedings include the 
eight full papers accepted and presented at the workshop.

We would like to thank the authors, the presenters, the general chair, the steering 
committee, the program committee, and the SC20 workshop chairs – without their 
excellent work and contributions WORKS would not be successful.
