On January 13, 2021, the [**workflowsRI**](http://workflowsri.org) and 
[ExaWorks](http://exaworks.org) projects organized the [**Workflows Community 
Summit**](https://workflowsri.org/summits/community/). This unique event 
gathered a select group of lead researchers from distinct workflow management 
systems, and sought to identify crucial challenges in the workflow community. 

This event was the first of a series of focused meetings, and has served to 
define the strategic goals for upcoming meetings with the science and workflow 
developer communities.

The summit program consisted of two overview talks about each project 
organizing the event, and six breakout sessions targeting pressing 
needs from the workflows community, as follows:

- Theme 1: FAIR computational workflows (Carole Goble)
- Theme 2: Training and education for workflow users (Lavanya Ramakrishnan)
- Theme 3: AI workflows (Luc Peterson)
- Theme 4: Exascale challenges and beyond (Bjoern Enders)
- Theme 5: APIs, interoperability, reuse, and standards (Douglas Thain)
- Theme 6: Building a workflows community (Ilkay Altintas)
