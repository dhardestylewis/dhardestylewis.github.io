### Motivation

Scientific workflows have been used almost universally across scientific domains, 
and have underpinned some of the most significant discoveries of the past several 
decades. Many of these workflows have high computational, storage, and/or communication 
demands, and thus must execute on a wide range of large-scale platforms, from large 
clouds to upcoming exascale high-performance computing (HPC) platforms. These executions 
must be managed using some software infrastructure. Due to the popularity of workflows, 
workflow management systems (WMSs) have been developed to provide abstractions for 
creating and executing workflows conveniently, efficiently, and portably. 

While these efforts are all worthwhile, there are now hundreds of independent WMSs, 
many of which are moribund. As a result, the WMS landscape is segmented and presents 
significant barriers to entry due to the hundreds of seemingly comparable, yet 
incompatible, systems that exist. As a result, many teams, small and large, still 
elect to build their own custom workflow solution rather than adopt, or build upon, 
existing WMSs. This current state of the WMS landscape negatively impacts workflow users, 
developers, and researchers. 

### The Summit

The [**Workflows Community Summit**](https://workflowsri.org/summits/community/) was 
held online on January 13, 2021. The overarching goal of the summit was to develop 
a view of the state of the art and identify crucial research challenges in the workflow 
community. Prior to the summit, a survey sent to stakeholders in the workflow community 
(including both developers of WMSs and users of workflows) helped to identify key challenges 
in this community that were translated into 6 broad themes for the summit, each of them 
being the object of a focused discussion led by a volunteer member of the community. 

The summit program consisted of two overview talks about each project
organizing the event, and six breakout sessions targeting pressing
needs from the workflows community, as follows:

- Theme 1: FAIR computational workflows ([Carole Goble](https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/carole.goble.html))
- Theme 2: Training and education for workflow users ([Lavanya Ramakrishnan](https://dst.lbl.gov/~lavanya/))
- Theme 3: AI workflows (Luc Peterson)
- Theme 4: Exascale challenges and beyond ([Bjoern Enders](https://www.nersc.gov/about/nersc-staff/data-science-engagement-group/bjoern-enders/))
- Theme 5: APIs, interoperability, reuse, and standards ([Douglas Thain](https://www3.nd.edu/~dthain/))
- Theme 6: Building a workflows community ([Ilkay Altintas](https://words.sdsc.edu/ilkay/))

The **[summit report](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4606958)** documents and organizes the 
wealth of information provided by the participants before, during, and after the summit.
